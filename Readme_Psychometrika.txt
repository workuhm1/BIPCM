Description:
	The scripts found in R and SAS folders were developed to simulate Bivariate Binary responses (y1_i;y2_i), 
	and to analyze the simulated data, respectively. Bivariate logistic regression (BLR) model, 
	sometimes referred to as Palmgren model, is used to simulate the data. For the analysis, 
	different dimensional and type of IPC models are fitted.

Tools: 
	For efficiency reason, SAS was run as a batch mode using the code shown below.
